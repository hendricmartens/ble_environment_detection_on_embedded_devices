# ble_environment_detection_on_embedded_devices
Environment detection using embedded neural networks to classify data obtained from BLE scans


code is still very unclean!!
I will clean it up till mid next week. 


Contains: <br>
-the detection algorithm to run on nRF52840 (which includes the algorithm to collect data samples)<br>
-and notebook to build and train the neural network
(alternative running in google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yisS1fo_dQ5WeFZsvQQ41gMlBqhGM532?usp=sharing)<br>
-the data used for training, testing and evaluation
